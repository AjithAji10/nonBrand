We measure our success by the success of our students (which means jobs, not side projects or freelancing gigs).

This is crucial so you understand what you are getting into. You WILL need to put in the work and we will support and cheer you all along. And post that, if you don't succeed, we will share the accountability with you.

    Thus, if you don't get placed at 4.5L or more post 15 months of training completion, we refund 60% of the fee back.

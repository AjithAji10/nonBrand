            The entire experience at Kraftshala was amazing as there was a lot
            more emphasis on practical knowledge, projects and learning from
            your mistakes rather than just mugging up concepts. In under 3
            months of training, I got an offer from Performics, the largest
            agency in India and one of my dream companies. So I'm really, really
            excited about it.

Before Kraftshala, I was confused and was exploring opportunities - I did not want to waste another year in preparing for CAT or settle by joining a mediocre college. That's when I came across Kraftshala and joined it - it covered everything I needed to start my professional journey. I highly recommend this program to people who want to switch to digital marketing.`,

If the Kraftshala routine was not there, then I would have struggled in my current job. But it's going smooth because of the habits made at Kraftshala.`,
